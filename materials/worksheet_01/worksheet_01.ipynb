    "Let us reconsider the TikTok ad example. In practice, the company testing the ads wants to present the new ad to all users as soon as possible, given that the new ad is superior. For example, imagine the company decided to conduct a balanced A/B test with 5000 users for each ad, in other words, $n_{\\text{new}}=n_{\\text{current}}=5000$. Now, suppose that 4000 users have watched the current ad and 4000 users have watched the new ad, and the dwell time of the new ad is 90% higher. Does the company really need to wait until 5000 users? Wouldn't it be better for the company to start using the new ad right away and start profiting more? This is called early stopping (because the test would be stopping earlier than planned). \n",

    "But how early? What if, instead of 4000 users for each ad, the company had observed only 3000? Would that be ok to stop? What about 500? 100? 50? 10? How about the company keeps monitoring the test statistic after each view of the ads? \n",
