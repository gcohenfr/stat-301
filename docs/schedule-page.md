### Learning Outcomes per Week

#### Week 1: Introduction to statistical modelling, and planned peeking for A/B testing optimization
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. 	Discuss why the methods they have learned in past courses are not sufficient to answer the more complex research problems being posed in this course (in particular stopping an A/B test early).
2.   Explain principled peeking and how it can be used for early stopping of an experiment (e.g., A/B testing). 
3.   Write a computer script to perform A/B testing optimization using principled peeking.
4.   Discuss the limitations of principled peeking for A/B testing optimization/early stopping of experiments.

#### Week 2: A/B testing optimization with a multi-armed bandit solution
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. 	Describe a multi-armed bandit solution for A/B testing optimization.
2. 	Write a computer script to perform A/B testing optimization using a multi-armed bandit solution.
3. 	Discuss the tradeoff between stopping earlier and certainty of significance, and the  real world implications (e.g., what does the FDA require for early stopping of clinical trials versus Facebook ads optimization?).
4.   List other questions related to A/B testing optimization that may be relevant in a real data application (e.g., what features cause a Facebook ad to perform best?)

#### Week 3: Introduction to generative modelling
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. 	Give an example of a question that could be answered by generative modelling.
2. 	Explain how a linear regression can be used to approximate the underlying mechanism that generated the data (quantitative response and input variables).
3.   Interpret the estimated coefficients and p-values derived from theoretical results in this simple setting.
4.   Discuss the assumptions made to estimate the coefficients and approximate their sampling distribution.
5.   Explain how to approximate the sampling distribution of the regression coefficient estimators using bootstrapping. 
6.   Contrast the sampling distribution approximated using theoretical results with bootstrapping alternatives in a simple setting (e.g., one input variable).
7.   Compute confidence intervals for the regression coefficients using theoretical approximations and bootstrapping results.
8.   Write a computer script to perform linear regression.
9. 	Explain the necessity of model-based approaches when the goal is to make inference about the generative model, whereas when the goal is to predict, both model-based and non-model based approaches can be used.

#### Week 4: Different kinds of input variables, and the difference between causation and association
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. 	Interpret the coefficients and p-values when input variables are categorical or ordinal.
2. 	Define interactions in the context of linear regression.
3. 	Write a computer script to perform linear regression when input variables are continuous or discrete, and when there are interactions between some of these variables.
4. 	Give an example of a real problem that aims to test a causal relationship between variables.
5.  Give an example of a real problem where the model can only establish an association between the response and the input variables.
6. 	Discuss how the desired goal of generative modelling is usually to make causal claims but it is often not easy do so (e.g., in observational studies).
7. Discuss the role of confounders in causal inference. 

#### Week 5: Mid-term #1 and preparation for projects
Part of the class time this week will be used for mid-term #1.  The remaining time is for independent studying where the students will propose a project to perform a data analysis using statistical models with several input variables.  

#### Week 6: Model diagnostics
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. 	Describe heteroscedasticity and the problem it presents to generative modelling. 
2. 	Write a computer script to assess whether there is heteroscedasticity in a given data set, and if so, use practical solutions to manage it. 
3. 	Describe collinearity, the problem it presents to generative modelling, and whether this problem needs to be addressed
4. 	Write a computer script to assess whether collinearity exists between input variables in a given data set, and if so, use practical solutions to manage it.
5. 	Discuss what model diagnostics the data scientist can use themselves and when the data scientist needs to consult a domain expert.

#### Week 7: Model selection and model metrics for generative modelling
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. 	List model metrics that are suitable for evaluation of a statistical model developed to make inference about the data-generating mechanism (e.g., R squared, AIC, Likelihood ratio test/F-test), their strengths and limitations, as well as how they are calculated.
2. 	Write a computer script to calculate these model metrics. Interpret and communicate the results from that computer script.
3. 	Explain the algorithms for the following variable selection methods:
    • F-test to compare nested models
    • Forward selection
    • Backward selection

#### Week 8: Mid-term #2 and preparation for projects
Part of the class time this week will be used for mid-term #2.  The remaining time is for independent studying on the selected project.  

#### Week 9: Introduction to predictive modelling 
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. 	Give an example of a question that can be answered by predictive modelling.
2. 	Explain when a linear regression is an appropriate model to predict new outcomes based on new values of the input variables.
3.   Explain how lasso can be used to estimate a predictive model and write a computer script to use lasso to predict new outcomes.
4.   List model metrics that are suitable for evaluation of a statistical model developed for the purpose of predictive modelling (e.g., RMSE), as well as how they are calculated.
5.   Discuss how different estimation methods can result in different predictions.
6.   Explain the difference between confidence intervals for prediction and prediction confidence intervals and what elements need to be estimated to construct these intervals.
7.   Write a computer script to calculate these intervals. Interpret and communicate the results from that computer script.

#### Week 10 : Predictive versus generative modelling - what’s the difference?
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1.   Give examples of questions that can be answered by generative models and others that can be answered by predictive models.
2. 	Discuss how the research question being asked impacts the statistical modelling procedures.
3.   Discuss why the model obtained directly from lasso is not the most suitable model for generative modelling and how post-lasso is one way to address this problem.
4.    Write a computer script to perform post-lasso and use it to estimate a generative model.
5. 	Discuss post inference problems (e.g., double dipping into the data set) and current practical solutions available to address these (e.g., data-splitting techniques).
6. 	Write a computer script to apply currently available practical solutions to post inference problems.
7. 	Discuss how the research question being asked impacts the communication of the results.

#### Week 11: Introduction to explanatory modelling when the response variable is categorical or a discrete count
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. 	Describe the logistic regression estimation procedure (categorical data as the response variable and explanatory variables), and Poisson regression estimation procedure (discrete counts as the response variable and explanatory variables).
2.   Discuss the relationship between linear regression and logistic and Poisson regression. Discuss the consequences of modelling data that is more suitable for logistic and Poisson regression models as a linear regression model.
3.   Interpret the coefficients and p-values in the logistic and Poisson regression settings.
4.   Discuss useful diagnostics for logistic and Poisson regression and explain why they should be performed. 
5.   Write a computer script to perform logistic and Poisson regression and perform model diagnostics. Interpret and communicate the results from that computer script.

#### Week 12: Classifiers as an important class of predictive models
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1.   Give an example of a research question that requires a predictive model to predict classes for new observations.
2. 	Explain the trade-offs between model-based and non-model based approaches, and describe situations where each might be the preferred approach.
3. 	Write a computer script to perform model selection using lasso to fit a logistic regression useful for predictive modelling.
4.   List model metrics that are suitable to evaluate predicted classes given by a predictive model with binary responses (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, Cohen's kappa).
5. 	Write a computer script to compute these model metrics. Interpret and communicate the results from that computer script.
 
#### Week 13: Project
This week is designed as independent studying where the students will be working on the selected project.
