### Coming from Python?
If you know Python and are not familiar with R (yet!), the following resources might help you
    link your Python knowledge to R:

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https:
            //pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/comparison/comparison_with_r.html">
            Pandas comparison with R
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>

### Where I go from here?
If you enjoyed the R experience and want to get deeper, the following references might be helpful. These
    references are completely overkill to this course, so do not try to follow them during the course,
    especially if you are short on time. These are post-course references.
